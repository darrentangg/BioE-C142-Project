# BioE-C142-Project
By exploiting the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions, I built single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV). AEVs allow you to train neural networks on both configurational and conformational space data. With this exploitation, a lightweight ANN was developed to generate accurate quantum energy predictions for organic compounds up to 4 heavy atoms within 1.5 kcal/mol. Applications as a low-compute alternative to traditional quantum mechanical calculations, such as Hartree-Fock (HF) and Density-Functional Theory (DFT).
